A **Coding Kata** is a programming exercise that you can perform to build and maintain your coding skills. Probably you already know **"Hello World"**, the simplest Kata possible.

**But where to find more Katas?** 

Here are a few places:

### Codewars
Plenty of small implementation tasks in 7+ languages. Results are checked online

[www.codewars.com](http://www.codewars.com/) 

### Codility
Commercial website with coding tasks as a recruiting tool. Great, autmatically tested katas. Besides paid access the website offers free katas for learning.

[codility.com](https://codility.com/)

### Rosalind
Katas for bioinformaticians. Contains algorithmic problems of increasing difficulty. It took me 5 days to stop coding when I found the site.

### The Coding Dojo Handbook
A book by **Emily Bache** describing a variety of Katas and how to set up a space for mutual learning.

### 57 Exercises for Programmers
A book by **Brian Hogan** full of beginner-friendly katas, each described on a single page. Ideal to learn programming.

### Academis
.. and of course, there are a few Katas on the Academis website as well:

## Conclusions

You can repeat Coding Katas once in a while. Try different languages, programming paradigms or automated tests to crank up the difficulty. Like running in sports, I consider doing Coding Katas a basic exercise to improve and to maintain your fitness as a programmer.

I wish you good coding.
